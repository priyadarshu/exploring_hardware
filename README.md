I explored my broken MI Note 2 phone 
Though I'm a noob to this, I found something interesting - 

## Proximity sensor
- A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact.
- A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks for changes in the field or return signal.

- Findings

    - Its the proximity sensor in the mobile that turns off the light when it senses our skin near it while talking
    
 ## Transmitters and Recievers
 - the mobile phone receiver/transmitter is built within or externally connected to the mobile phone and includes a power supply unit, an incoming call detector, a coder/decoder, a spread spectrum function module, a radio frequency circuit, a memory, a main controller and an off-hook/on-hook circuit.
